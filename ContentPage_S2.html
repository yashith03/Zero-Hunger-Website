        <h3>Understanding Urban Hunger</h3>
        <p>Urban hunger refers to the phenomenon where individuals and families living in urban areas lack access to sufficient and nutritious food. Despite the perception of cities as centers of abundance, many urban residents struggle with food insecurity due to various socio-economic factors.</p>
    </div> 
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>What are Food Deserts?</h3>
        <p>Food deserts are areas, typically in urban neighborhoods, where residents have limited access to affordable and nutritious food. These areas often lack grocery stores, farmers' markets, and other sources of fresh produce and healthy food options. Instead, residents may rely on convenience stores or fast food outlets, which tend to offer predominantly unhealthy and processed foods.</p>
    </div>
