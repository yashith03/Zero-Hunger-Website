                    <p>Food security means everyone has access to enough safe, nutritious food for a healthy life. It's not just about quantity but also quality. Factors like income, food prices, agriculture, climate, and policies affect it. Solving food security means addressing poverty, inequality, food distribution, and sustainable farming.</p>
